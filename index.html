	<p class="paragraph">My entry in the 2018 <a class="contentlink" href="https://itch.io/jam/playmaker">Playmaker Game Jam</a>. The themes were <b>'Last Resort'</b> and <b>'Not A Hero'</b>. After finding out the themes, I immideately thought of Donald Trump. In <b>Donald Trump's Hotel Defense</b> you play as Donald Trump defeding his final hotel from zombie tourists. It is a casual game with no real goal. Donald's head always rolls back to you.</p>

		<h4>What is Warrior Brawl?</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">Warrior Brawl is a two player brawler inspired by Smash Bros. Each character will have their own unique attacks and fighting syle. 
			The combat will be heavily <b>analog</b> giving the player a high ammount of control of the character they are playing as. 
			Each attack will be composed of using the <b>attack</b> button and <b>directional input</b> the player uses with the control stick.</p>

		<h4>Input</h4>
		<img src="Images/button_example01.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="input"/><hr>
		<p class="paragraph">
		Each character will have their own unique attacks. The player determines which attack to perform with a combination of an <b>attack button</b> and a <b>direction</b> input on the controller's
		stick. These attacks create a specific collision box depending on the orientation of the attack. Each attack will have it's own specific damage ammount as well as a knockback. Most directional attacks will not
		involve projectile, but there may be exceptions. The characters will also have their own unique <b>special</b> attacks. These may involve projectiles, buffs and other variable traits. 
		Each character will have a
		set of the following:</p><hr>
